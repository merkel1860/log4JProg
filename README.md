# log4JProg
This project is a couple of examples that introduce beginner to Log4j2 and help them to grasp quickly the foundation of the framework. 
It composes of two branches: the former is for basic configuration and manipulation of Log4j and the latter attempts to dive
deep in some fancy features of Log4j2 such as storing logs in Database, making use of rolling file, auto-delete older 
archives, and so on.
